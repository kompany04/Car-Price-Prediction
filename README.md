Car Price Prediction

Welcome to the Car Price Prediction project repository! This project aims to predict the prices of used cars using various machine learning algorithms. The predictive models implemented include Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest Regression. Additionally, a Streamlit web application has been developed to allow users to predict car prices in real-time.

Overview
In this project, we leverage machine learning techniques to predict the prices of used cars based on various features such as mileage, age, brand, model, and more. The predictive models are trained on a dataset containing historical information about used car sales.

Algorithms Used
Logistic Regression: A regression algorithm used to model the probability of a binary outcome.
Decision Tree: A non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression tasks.
Random Forest Regression: An ensemble learning method that constructs a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputs the average prediction of the individual trees.
Features
Utilizes scikit-learn library for machine learning algorithms.
Implements pipelines to streamline data preprocessing and model training.
Develops a Streamlit web application for real-time car price prediction.

Dependencies:
Python 3.x
